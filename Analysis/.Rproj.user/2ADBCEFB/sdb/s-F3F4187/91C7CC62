Upon initially reading in the \"Temp\" and \"CityTemp\" data sets, it was determined that some cleaning was required. \n\n    + Note: This process of reading in the data and cleaning it was performed in the R script files \"Gather.R\" and \"TidyData.R\". These files can be found within the \"Analysis/\" folder. The \"Temp.csv\" and \"CityTemp.csv\" files can be found in the \"Analysis/Data/\" folder.\n\n2. We cleaned \"Temp.csv\" and \"CityTemp.csv\" with \"TidyData.R\".\n\n    + The Temp data did not have dates in the same format. Additionally, it was not restricted to years since 1900, as the analysis questions of interest required.\n    + The CityTemp data also did not have dates in the same format. We made the same corrections to it.\n    + The dataframes created in TidyData.R were used in the analysis to create \"Analysis.Rmd\".\n  \n\n### The Analysis:\n\n* An analysis was performed using the dataframes created by \"TidyData.R\" to answer two main questions, with some associated sub-questions. These questions for the analysis were answered in the \"Analysis.Rmd\" file, located in ./Analysis/ folder. A conclusion to the analysis is contained in \"Analysis.Rmd\" -- listed after the answers to all the questions. The best location to view the final analysis with output and the conclusion is by viewing \"Analysis.md\", located in the same folder.\n\n    + The analysis in \"Analysis.Rmd\" sources \"Gather.R\" and then sources \"TidyData.R\".\n    \n    + **Please navigate to the ./Analysis/ folder to view the analysis. Or, use this [link](https://github.com/chavenstein/MSDS6306-CaseStudy2/blob/master/Analysis/Analysis.md).** \n    + If you are viewing the analysis in GitHub, please specifically navigate to the file \"Analysis.md\" in the ./Analysis/ folder. **This will allow you to view the output to the R code snippets in GitHub.**\n\n",
